Sardinian Beaches App

The Sardinian Government are looking to improve their online web site. They want to develop some interactive app that display information about Sardinian’s beaches. Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. You need to create an API to bring in content.
